# Meeting Slot Suggestion Lab Repository

This repository contains the starter code, templates, and tests for the **Requirements Specification and LLM‑Assisted Development** lab. Students will implement a meeting slot suggestion function, write specifications, and explore the impact of requirements completeness on AI‑assisted coding.

## Structure

- **solution.py** – Stub file where you implement `suggest_slots`. Do not rename this file.
- **test_solution.py** – Public tests you can run to check basic correctness. Use a test runner such as `pytest` to execute these tests.


## Running Tests

1. Install Python 3 if not already installed.
2. Implement your solution in `solution.py`.
3. Optionally create `student_tests.py` and write at least 10 test cases.
4. Run tests using:

```bash
pytest file_name.py
```

5. Fix any failing tests before moving on. Remember that hidden tests will check additional requirements (e.g., buffer enforcement, day‑specific rules, invariants, tie‑breaking, and the Wednesday blackout window).
